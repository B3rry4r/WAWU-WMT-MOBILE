# INBOX-08 · Paid DM threads and the creator's queue

## Read first

- `docs/WORKFLOW.md` (the rules every task follows)
- `docs/roles/BUILDER.md` or `docs/roles/VERIFIER.md`, whichever your prompt names
- `docs/people/DEV2.md` (what you own)
- This task changes `wawu-backend`. Start the session with that repo and `wawu-wmt-mobile` both attached; follow that repo's CLAUDE.md for its commands.
- `docs/fintava/` (Fintava's docs and real sandbox responses, task OPS-02)

## Goal

A backend gap behind lane B's screens, from docs/analysis/ANALYSIS-EVIDENCE.md. Additive only.

## Scope

Group paid DMs into threads; several reply bubbles in the window; creator's waiting list by deadline with the total waiting.

## Capability checks

- [ ] A creator sees questions ordered by deadline with the right total.

## Builder report

_Filled in by the builder (docs/roles/BUILDER.md). Files changed, each check and how it was tested, gate counts before and after, gaps and shared-change requests filed, anything not done and why._

## Verifier report

_Filled in by the verifier (docs/roles/VERIFIER.md). One row per pass: passed, failed or NOT RUN with the reason, and where the evidence is. Then findings: defect, differs-for-recorded-reason (cite the decision), or unclear._

## Owner sign-off

_Owner: date, and "screenshots and evidence pack reviewed"._
